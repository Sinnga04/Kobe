      Man, I can’t believe how fast twenty years went by. This is crazy. This is
      absolutely crazy. And you know, to be standing here at center court with
      you guys, my teammates behind me, and appreciating all this journey that
      we’ve been on. You know we’ve been through our ups and we’ve been through
      our downs, and I think the most important part is we all stay together
      throughout. I grew up a die-hard, I mean a die-hard Laker fan, die-hard. I
      knew everything about every player that has played here. So to be drafted
      and then traded to this organisation and to spend 20 years here, you can't
      write something better than this.

        Planning was key for Kobe. He developed detailed plans for training,
        practice schedules, nutrition, and recovery — all with the end goal in
        mind. He kept himself disciplined by sticking to those plans even when
        it wasn’t easy or convenient. The commitment was also essential for Kobe
        — he continually worked hard day in and day out to become an even better
        player than he already was.
